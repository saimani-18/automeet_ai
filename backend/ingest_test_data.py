        MEETING: Flask Application Architecture Review
        DATE: September 28, 2024
        ATTENDEES: Sarah (Tech Lead), Mike (Backend), Emily (Frontend), John (DevOps)
        
        Sarah: Let's review our Flask application architecture. We need to decide between monolithic vs microservices.
        Mike: For our scale, I recommend starting with a modular monolith. We can use Blueprints for separation.
        Emily: We should consider React for frontend with a clean API separation. What database should we use?
        Mike: PostgreSQL for production, SQLite for development. We need proper connection pooling.
        John: For deployment, I suggest Docker containers with Nginx reverse proxy. We need CI/CD from day one.
        
        TECHNICAL DECISIONS:
        1. Use Flask Blueprints for modular architecture
        2. PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
        3. React frontend with REST API
        4. Docker containerization
        5. GitHub Actions for CI/CD
        
        Sarah: Let's also establish coding standards and review process.
        Mike: We should use Flask-Migrate for database migrations and Pytest for testing.
        Emily: For frontend, we'll use React with TypeScript and Vite for building.
        
        ACTION ITEMS:
        1. Mike: Set up Flask project structure with Blueprints by Oct 5
        2. Emily: Create React prototype with API integration by Oct 7
        3. John: Prepare Docker setup and CI/CD pipeline by Oct 10
        4. Sarah: Document architecture decisions and coding standards

        MEETING: Vendor Selection & Technology Stack Finalization
        DATE: September 29, 2024
        ATTENDEES: Sarah, Mike, Emily, John, David (CTO)
        
        David: We need to finalize our cloud provider and key technology choices.
        Sarah: We're comparing AWS vs Google Cloud. AWS has better enterprise support.
        Mike: Google Cloud has better ML services and pricing for our scale.
        Emily: For monitoring, we're considering Datadog vs New Relic vs self-hosted Prometheus.
        John: Datadog is easier to setup but expensive. Prometheus gives us more control.
        
        DECISION FACTORS CONSIDERED:
        - Cost efficiency at scale
        - Developer experience and documentation
        - Enterprise support and SLAs
        - Integration with existing tools
        - Long-term maintainability
        
        FINAL DECISIONS:
        1. Cloud Provider: Google Cloud Platform (better pricing for our expected growth)
        2. Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana (cost-effective, more control)
        3. CI/CD: GitHub Actions (already using GitHub, good integration)
        4. Container Registry: Google Container Registry (native GCP integration)
        
        RISKS IDENTIFIED:
        - GCP learning curve for team (mitigation: training sessions)
        - Prometheus maintenance overhead (mitigation: dedicated DevOps resource)
        - Vendor lock-in with GCP (mitigation: multi-cloud design where possible)
        
        Sarah: We'll review these decisions in 3 months to ensure they're still optimal.
