# 🤖 AutoMeet – AI-Powered Meeting Assistant  

Meetings are where decisions are made — but too often, the details slip through the cracks.  
**AutoMeet** is an intelligent assistant that **automatically joins your meetings, transcribes discussions, captures action items, and delivers instant follow-ups.**  

It’s like having a teammate who never forgets, always listens, and keeps everyone on track.

## 💡 The Problem We’re Solving  

- ❌ Action items are forgotten or buried in emails.  
- ⏱️ Latecomers waste time catching up.  
- 🗂️ Meeting data is scattered across chats, docs, and inboxes.

👉 AutoMeet solves these by combining **calendar integration, live transcription, AI-driven task extraction, and cross-meeting search** into a single platform.

## 🌍 Vision

AutoMeet is more than a meeting tool — it’s a **productivity partner**.
We imagine a future where:

* Teams focus on *decisions*, not note-taking.
* No idea or deadline is ever lost.
* Meetings become a **knowledge hub**, not just a calendar event.

✨ With **AutoMeet**, meetings don’t just happen — they turn into progress.
